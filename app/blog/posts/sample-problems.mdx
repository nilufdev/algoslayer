## Facilitates Tooling and Refactoring

Modern IDEs leverage static typing to offer advanced features like code completion, refactoring, and static analysis. These tools can automatically detect issues, suggest fixes, and safely refactor code, enhancing developer productivity and reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs during refactoring.

```csharp
// Refactoring example: Renaming a method in C#
public class Calculator {
    public int Add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

// After refactoring `Add` to `Sum`, all references are automatically updated.
public class Calculator {
    public int Sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```
