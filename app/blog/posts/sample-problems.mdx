**Are you Hashira-level enough to solve them all?**

### Problem A (100 Points)

We have an $N \times N$ square grid.

We will paint each square in the grid either black or white.

If we paint exactly $A$ squares white, how many squares will be painted black?

## Constraints

* $1 \le N \le 100$
* $0 \le A \le N^2$

## Inputs

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

$N$
$A$

## Solution

An $N \times N$ grid contains a total of $N^2$ squares. Since we are painting $A$ of those squares white, the number of squares to be painted black is $N^2 - A$.

Therefore, the solution is to read $N$ and $A$ from the input and output the result of $N^2 - A$.

## Conclusion

As you finish these warm-up tasks, view them as the essential practice needed to sharpen your skills for the battle ahead. True mastery isn't just about complex moves; it’s about the precision of your fundamentals. By perfecting your logic here, you ensure your solutions stay sharp and efficient even when the difficulty spikes during the Final Selection. Use this momentum to polish your approach and prepare yourself for the ultimate test in the main competition.
