### Problem A

We have an $N \times N$ square grid. We will paint each square in the grid either black or white. If we paint exactly $A$ squares white, how many squares will be painted black?

## Constraints

* $1 \le N \le 100$
* $0 \le A \le N^2$

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

$N$  
$A$

## Solution

An $N \times N$ grid contains a total of $N^2$ squares. Since we are painting $A$ of those squares white, the number of squares to be painted black is $N^2 - A$.

Therefore, the solution is to read $N$ and $A$ from the input and output the result of $N^2 - A$.

```python
N = int(input())
A = int(input())

total = N * N
print(total - A)
```

### Problem B

You are given an integer sequence of length $N$, $A = (A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N)$, and an integer $M$.

Determine whether it is possible to remove one of the $N$ elements of $A$ so that the sum of the remaining $(N - 1)$ elements is exactly $M$.

## Constraints

* $2 \le N \le 100$
* $0 \le M \le 10000$
* $0 \le A_i \le 100$
* All input values are integers.

## Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

$N \quad M$  
$A_1 \quad A_2 \quad \dots \quad A_N$

## Output

If it is possible to remove one of the $N$ elements of $A$ so that the sum of the remaining $(N - 1)$ elements is exactly $M$, print `Yes`; otherwise, print `No`.

## Solution

We can calculate the total sum $S$ of all elements in $A$. Then for each element we can check if we removed that item then sum of remaining items is exactly $M$ or not by doing $S - A_i$, and print answer is `Yes` if it's equal to $M$.

```python
N, M = map(int, input().split())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

S = 0
for x in A:
  S += x

found = False

for x in A:
  if S-x == M:
    found = True
    break
  
if found:
  print('Yes')
else:
  print('No')
```
