### Problem A: The Entry-Level Strike

In the **Final Selection**, Problem A serves as your opening move. While it won't require complex strategies, it demands the focus of a true slayer to avoid careless mistakes.

#### What to Expect
* **Difficulty Level:** This is a "First Form" challenge, designed to be solved quickly. It typically focuses on basic arithmetic, simple loops, or basic string manipulation.
* **The Goal:** You should aim to find the solution almost instantly. The main hurdle isn't the logic itself, but how accurately and fast you can translate the requirements into clean code.
* **The Trap:** Don't let your guard down. Most errors here come from misreading the constraints or failing to handle small edge cases—like a zero or an unexpected input range.

## Facilitates Tooling and Refactoring

Modern IDEs leverage static typing to offer advanced features like code completion, refactoring, and static analysis. These tools can automatically detect issues, suggest fixes, and safely refactor code, enhancing developer productivity and reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs during refactoring.

```csharp
// Refactoring example: Renaming a method in C#
public class Calculator {
    public int Add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

// After refactoring `Add` to `Sum`, all references are automatically updated.
public class Calculator {
    public int Sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

As you finish these warm-up tasks, view them as the essential practice needed to sharpen your skills for the battle ahead. True mastery isn't just about complex moves; it’s about the precision of your fundamentals. By perfecting your logic here, you ensure your solutions stay sharp and efficient even when the difficulty spikes during the Final Selection. Use this momentum to polish your approach and prepare yourself for the ultimate test in the main competition.
