### Problem A (100 Points)

We have an $N \times N$ square grid.

We will paint each square in the grid either black or white.

If we paint exactly $A$ squares white, how many squares will be painted black?

## Constraints

* $1 \le N \le 100$
* $0 \le A \le N^2$

## Inputs

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

$N$
$A$

## Solution

An $N \times N$ grid contains a total of $N^2$ squares. Since we are painting $A$ of those squares white, the number of squares to be painted black is $N^2 - A$.

Therefore, the solution is to read $N$ and $A$ from the input and output the result of $N^2 - A$.
